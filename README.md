# Azure-K8s-SQL-Server-Container
This repository has guide to deploying SQL Server as a container to Azure Kubernetes Service.
<p>In the new app. world, containers are playing a crucial part.  There is no more debate on whether or not to use containers. Containers and deeply engrossed in application development, deployment, and management in short ALM. The trend around application development these days has been more shifted on the microservice architecture model.</p>
<p>I won't go in the debate of what a purist microservice architecture looks like, as I see people around the industry understand the microservice ideology differently. I don't think that's people's fault, I would look at it from a different lens that the microservice model is a recent introduction and will need time to digest by the wider software community.</p>
<p>Not getting more distracted from the agenda, we are here to discussing the containerized SQL server option. Any application since the beginning of the time of application development need a persistence layer, this can be a file system, normalized database and off recent the denormalized database model has been very popular. But the normalized  database model is still the leader as a major part of the community understands that well.</p>
<p>Now reconnecting the dots in the new world we need the normalized persistence layer, which should align with Containerised/Microservice architecture. Containerized/Microservice architecture is more about being nimble, agile,  separation of concerns, and inverted dependency, having a conventional SQL server (normalized DB) instance, ruins the ideology of microservice architecture.<br /><img class="alignnone  wp-image-4640" src="https://khanasif1.files.wordpress.com/2020/08/1.jpg" alt="1" width="676" height="290" /></p>
<p>So Microsoft data solution team introduced <a href="https://hub.docker.com/_/microsoft-mssql-server">SQL Server on docker container</a>, this is a great offering as now you can build microservice architecture with a polyglot persistence. Not only the application, but the persistence layer can also well align with the ideologies for microservice architecture I shared earlier.</p>
